# JS30 DrumKit
Excorcise 01 in WesBos' JavaScript30 tutorials. 

After recently graduating from coding bootcamp, I wanted to sharpen my skills, starting with JS. 
Many others had pointed me to this WesBos tutorial series. As I found myself having less and less time to code day to day since finishing bootcamp and returning 
to a normal full time work scheudle and family. This 30day challenge will help keep me on track some code on the keys each day!

In this tutorial I learned a new HTML tag &lt;kbd&gt; for keyboard inputs, as we did not discuss screen readers too much in our bootcamp. 

I had recently come across the process of using JS to alter CSS classes when applying for a position that had me re-create a site.

Which I absolutely love, this to me is a simple form of the "wizardry" of JS.
